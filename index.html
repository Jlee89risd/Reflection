        <p class="reflection1">The article well informed me of the importance of personal websites. As I haven’t really thought deeply about the webs, and how social media do not really reflect on people’s actual needs. It was my first time thinking about the idea of webs itself instead of examples of websites such as instagram or wikipedia. As a student who is studying in design school, it seems very important to understand the meaning of the webs and grow out personal webs for reconstructing the future of the webs. It also encourages me to think about ways to develop my personal space using coding as a tool for designing. Laurel Schwults referred to personal webs as house, garden, plants or puddle, and it also made a lot of sense. And I also hope webs to reflect people’s hopes and fulfill dreams rather than magnify people’s fear and deepen divisions as Berners Lee mentioned.
