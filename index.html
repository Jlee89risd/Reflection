        <p class="reflection1">The article well informed me of the importance of personal websites. As I haven’t really thought deeply about the webs, and how social media do not really reflect on people’s actual needs. It was my first time thinking about the idea of webs itself instead of examples of websites such as instagram or wikipedia. As a student who is studying in design school, it seems very important to understand the meaning of the webs and grow out personal webs for reconstructing the future of the webs. It also encourages me to think about ways to develop my personal space using coding as a tool for designing. Laurel Schwults referred to personal webs as house, garden, plants or puddle, and it also made a lot of sense. And I also hope webs to reflect people’s hopes and fulfill dreams rather than magnify people’s fear and deepen divisions as Berners Lee mentioned.

        <p class="reflection2">The essay was basically telling me the reason why people should keep making hand made webs. Most of the websites these days are focusing on productiveness, neatness and comfort of people who are using. Those might seem like a good movement, but it can be far from people’s creativity. Hand made webs are important because they stay different from the normal commercial webs and keep webs to stay as a form of an art. It might be slow, inefficient, and hard to access, but it can be interesting and fun to use. Since I’ve always accessed websites for specific reasons such as shopping or researching, thinking of a website as a space where people can experience other’’s creativity was interesting. The idea of personal web from the other essay and the other concept of hand made web from this essay really makes me think of the reasons why I should also think about the reasons why those webs are so important.

        <p class="reflection2">Hello World by Taeyoon Choi was a short essay, but it encompass a lot of important contents inside. Computer is part of human's life, but I feel like only few people are really interested in the inside of the computer. The author of this essay also questioned the similar thing and picked abstraction as something that's blocking people from understanding. Computer is made of binary codes which are deeply complicated, but looking at the interface of the computer stops people from thinking about the inside. The author also made an important comparison between city, art and computer. The repeated patterns that are shown in the inside of the computer also shows up quite often in the city planning. It has both visual and structural importance. And it is also shown in the form of arts. In conclusion, looking inside the computer makes people to question about more things than just how computer works.
